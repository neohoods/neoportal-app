# Cursor Rules for NeoHoods Platform

## CRITICAL RULE: CODE COMPILATION

- **NEVER** provide code that doesn't compile
- **ALWAYS** run `npm run build` to verify compilation before presenting code
- **ALWAYS** fix all TypeScript errors before showing any code changes
- If compilation fails, fix ALL errors before proceeding
- Never ask user to review non-compiling code

## Code Quality Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Follow Angular best practices
- Use proper type definitions
- Ensure all imports are correct
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Fix all linting errors

## UI/UX Standards

- Use Taiga UI components consistently
- Ensure proper i18n with @ngx-translate/core
- Use white backgrounds for cards as requested
- Implement proper stringify functions for tui-select components
- Fix all rendering issues (no [object Object] displays)

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes
2. Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
3. Fix any errors found
4. Only then present the working code to user
5. Never present broken code for review

## Backend Development Rules

- **NEVER** provide Java code that doesn't compile
- **ALWAYS** run `mvn compile` or `mvn clean install` to verify compilation
- **ALWAYS** fix all compilation errors before showing any code
- Ensure all imports are correct and dependencies are properly declared
- Follow Spring Boot best practices and conventions
- Use proper JPA annotations and entity relationships
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Follow REST API design principles
- Ensure all endpoints have proper OpenAPI documentation

- Follow database migration best practices with Flyway
- Ensure proper transaction management
- Use proper caching strategies where appropriate

## User Feedback Priority
